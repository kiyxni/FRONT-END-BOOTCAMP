// 1. Set your name as a variable
let myName = "Waqar";

// 2. Set your age as a variable
let myAge = 26;

/* 3. Define a new variable, message using concatenation as
// "Hello my name is myName and i am myAge years old to the console. */
console.log("Hello my name is " + myName + " and I am " + myAge + " years old. What is your name?");
    // << result: Hello my name is Waqar and I am 26 years old. >> //

// 4. Try changing the variables and console logging.

// Changed the original values back and forth //
/* let myName = "Waqar Kiyani";
let myAge = 500;
console.log("Hello my name is " + myName + " and I am " + myAge + " years old.");*/
